title: First Project

This week I finished my first project (mini-project really) as a data scientist.  The goal was to help a Woman's Tech
organization figure out the best subway station to acquire signatures of people interested in receiving a free ticket
for a gala to raise money and awareness for women in technology.  We were tasked with using publicly available MTA
turnstile data (which is fairly messy) towards that end.  

The code I wrote acquires the files as needed and rewrites the resulting DataFrame into columns that are more usable for analysis. I was also able to determine the daily average hourly exits (or entries) for each station, despite irregular collection times and intervals.  As a result, the organization would have an idea of about how many people leave a given station in an hour.  I thought that would be helpful in figuring out which stations to choose and how many people to deploy to each station.  Here's a link to the code I wrote:
