title: First Project

This week I finished my first project (mini-project really) as a data scientist.  The goal was to help a Woman's Tech
organization figure out the best subway station to acquire signatures of people interested in receiving a free ticket
for a gala to raise money and awareness for women in technology.  We were tasked with using publicly available MTA
turnstile data (which is fairly messy) towards that end.  

The code I wrote acquires the files as needed and rewrites it into columns that are more usable for analysis.
I was also able to determine average hourly exits (or entries) on a daily basis for each station, despite irregular
collection times and intervals.  Here's a link to what I wrote:
