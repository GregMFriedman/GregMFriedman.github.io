I was born and raised here in New York until I moved to Philadelphia to do my undergrad at the University of Pennslyvania.  After, I spent a few years teaching English in Spain (and learning Spanish), until returning to NYC to teach Math with the Math for America fellowship. Fresh off my nupitals, I'm turning the page yet again to a new chapter in Data Science.
