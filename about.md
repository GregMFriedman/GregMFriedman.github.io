### More Information

I was born and raised here in New York until I moved to Philadelphia to do my undergrad at the University of Pennslyvania.  I spent a few years teaching English in Spain (and learning Spanish) until returning to teach Math back in NYC with the Math for America fellowship for the past 5 years.  Fresh off my nupitals, I'm turning the page yet again, this time to a career in Data Science.
